    <p>
      My dearest love,<br><br>
      Demi, you are the most special person to me. You mean so much more than I can say. Every single moment with you feels so special to me. Everything you say touches my heart in a way it feels warm and comforting. Seriously I can't even describe how much I love you because the love for you is so much more than just words. Every momenet of everyday I just think of you. Hours of my day go by thinking of you. Every notification I get I hope its from you and when it is it makes me so happy its like the best feeling ever. Out of everyone i've ever known, been friends with or close to, nobody has ever been like you. You're so unique, so perfect and that makes you so special to me. You understand me like no one ever did or will. With you I feel so safe, I can just be myself and you don't make me feel bad about it and instead you're always super nice and thats just one of the cutest things about you. I want you to know that I love you so much and maybe I don't show it enough to you but I try my best to make you know. The care you give me and the stuff you do for me show that you truly do love me and its not just you saying it. You're so important to me Demi, you're my whole life. I can't imagine my days without you. No matter what happens I'll always keep choosing you. I want to be with you, spend moments with you, build memories with you, support you, do my all for you and keep loving you more every day. <br><br> 
      Have an amazing day baby. Happy Birthday ❤️<br><br>
      Yours forever,<br>
      Shubi
